## Agricultural activities are responsible for a large proportion of New York state's nitrous oxide and methane emissions.
Nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture account for 75% of New York's nitrous oxide emissions. Methane emissions from agriculture account for 23% of total methane emisisons in the state, second only to landfill methane emissions. Manure management and enteric fermentation from livestock account for more than half of total agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, while nitrous oxide emissions from soil management accounts for the remainder. Reducing the climate footprint of agriculture in New York will require mitigating methane emissions from livestock activities, reducing nitrogen emissions from croplands, and promoting the adoption of activities which sequester carbon.

* In 2016, manure management released 1.3 MMT CO2eq as methane and nitrous oxide.
* Enteric fermentation released 3.6 MMT CO2eq as methane. 
* Soil management released 4.0 MMT as nitrous oxide.

## Climate change poses unique threats to New York animal agriculture.
New York is the third largest dairy-producing state, responsible for more than half of US milk production. Climate change will pose direct threats to milk production at dairies through the impact of heat stress on dairy cows, which are particularly sensitive to heat, as well as indirectly through impacts on feed production. Dairy cows undergo physiological changes in order to cope with heat stress, and these result in declines in milk production as well as changes in milk quality. Under heat stress, dairy cows produce milk with reduced fat and protein content. (Kadzere et al., 2002; St-Pierre et al., 2003; West, 2003). Heat stress additionally results in decreased calving and greater vulnerability to other health risks. The impacts of short periods of heat stress on milk production can persist for several months, making dairy cows susceptible to increases in the frequency of temperature extremes with climate change even if these are limited to particular days.

The effects of heat stress on milk production are already visible, and will continue to be exacerbated by climate change. According to data from the USDA ERS, heat stress was responsible for losses of approximately $39,000 in annual milk production for the average U.S. dairy in 2010. This corresponds to $1.2 billion in lost production for the entire dairy sector [^1]. Projections of increasing heat stress on dairy production suggest that these losses will rise. According to a report from Cornell, milk production is estimated to fall by 248-437 pounds per cow per year, with projected end-of-century economic losses associated with heat stress at approximately $37-$66 per cow per year.

## Animal agriculture in New York is increasingly consolidated. 
12% of dairies account for nearly 70% of New York's dairy cow population. In 2017, only 561 farms in New York state had herd sizes over 200 cows. These operations are responsible for the bulk of methane emissions from animal agriculture. Integrating mitigating strategies to reduce emissions from these operations has the potential to reduce overall state emissions.
